# POWER RANGERS HEADGEAR

A Power Rangers Mega-Team production, part headgear! It is painted blue, has built in padding and has a visor made out of a plastic cup that refracts light from a hidden TFT screen onto the face of the beholder. As Power Rangers team one (from the first ever demo), we had to look the best but then Selena took the spotlight... so yay Selena! The effect-like visor adds on to the compatible wings and morpher.
